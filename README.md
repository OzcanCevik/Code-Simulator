# Skulpt Powedered 

## Project Description

This project aims to develop software for a robot to understand its situation and produce appropriate reactions. For example, if the robot falls while walking, it should be able to decide what to do on its own. The software will use sensor data to identify situations and respond appropriately. Additionally, the robot will store previous experiences in memory, allowing it to react faster when encountering similar situations again.
